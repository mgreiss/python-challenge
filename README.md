# python-challenge
The PyPoll challenge kept me on a loop. I frequently went back and forth between referencing class notes in Slack, utilizing Xpert Learning, and rewatching class Zoom recordings. What really threw me off about PyPoll was the starting document with the commented-out instructions. Those comments led me to believe I was missing steps, causing me to include additional steps that weren't needed. I even repeated some steps, such as:
winning_candidate = ""  # To store the name of the winning candidate
winning_count = 0  # To store the highest vote count

Which Ultimately, I didn’t need those to achieve the desired outcome. This was definitely a significant learning curve for me.

Another step that was included but unnecessary, which also elongated the run time, was:
 # Print a loading indicator (for large datasets)
 # print(". ", end="")

Since it was provided, I assumed it was needed, but it wasn’t.

The PyBank challenge was easier to tackle. Defining variables is something I can now recall from memory. For the last couple of steps, I relied on Xpert Learning to solidify my understanding of the code, but I now grasp how that code produces the desired outcome.

Overall, I relied heavily on in-class practices and Xpert Learning.
